Requirements
For the Networking courses, you would need to have two machines with Linux installed on them. Both machines should have a Network card installed. If you are using a machine that is already connected to a Local Area Network then you do not need a second machine.

Outcome
After further completing the Network Administrators course, and this would include all associated exercises, labs and simulated problem labs, you would be able to work as a Junior Network Administrator.
