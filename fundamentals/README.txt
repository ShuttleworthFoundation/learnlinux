Outcome
In order to successfully complete the Fundamentals course you will need to have knowledge of PC Computers (operating systems and hardware).

After completion of the Fundamentals course , you would have a basic grounding of the Linux Operating System.

Please note however that although an introductory course to Linux it is not an introduction to computers or operating systems. We assume that you have some technical knowledge already.

In this course, some internal operations of the operating system are covered simply, and this is in order to ensure that you are able to think a problem through laterally. This will also assist if wishing to complete the range all the way through to the Internals course, by giving you a grounding in simple terms to build on throughout the other courses.
