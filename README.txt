Welcome, Learn Linux is an Open Source project that aims to develop Free/Open Source GNU/Linux Training Materials. The project initiative is supported by The Shuttleworth Foundation under the direction of the Open Source Team.

What makes this project special is that it is the first of its kind in South Africa and the international open source community. While there are many documentation projects centered on documenting Linux based software, this is the first project to develop a curriculum and course materials that can be freely used by anyone wanting to "Learn Linux" or to teach Linux to others.

The course materials are licensed under a Creative Commons license. Under this license, it is our hope that they will be used by private individuals and commercial organizations to learn and teach Linux.

We hope that everyone who benefits from these courses will take the time to participate in the "gift culture" of the Learn Linux Project.
