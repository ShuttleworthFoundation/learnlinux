Overview
This course is designed to help the student understand the inner workings of the Linux kernel. Often a good understanding of how the operating system manages hardware and other resources to do its work, will helps people solve problems and appreciate the work that goes into making a computer work.

Structure
Approximately ?? hours

Requirements
You need to have two or more networked computers to take part in this course. One computer must have Linux installed.

Outcome
Internals^-1 is a technical course written to enable a System Administrator to become a visionary systems engineer able to attend a full internals course if so inclined. A cautionary note would be that although we have kept it as generically inclined as possible you may have to check up the variances with the Linux or Unix kernel that you are working with.

As we have said from the beginning, support of such an operating system is going to take a fair amount of lateral thinking, and as not all of us are interested in the "nitty-gritty" details of how an operating system was written (see reference material used if you are interested), so internals^-1 will give you the workings in a more simple technical form.
